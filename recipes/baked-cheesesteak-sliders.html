    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>10 mini sandwich rolls</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pickled peppers</li>
        <li>½ cup cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups freshly shredded provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season steak generously with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Sear steaks for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip; add diced onions to the sides. Cook until steaks begin to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes more. Push onions under the steaks and cook until browned but still crunchy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove steaks to a plate.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place rolls on a baking pan lined with foil. Hollow out the top of each roll by cutting in at a 45-degree angle. Pinch off some of the bread inside to make room for the filling.</li>
        <li>Slice steaks into thin strips, then across into 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add the sauteed onions and accumulated juices. Toss in pickled peppers, cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups provolone, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Mix until thoroughly combined. Taste and season with salt as needed. Spoon filling into the rolls and top with remaining provolone cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and edges of the rolls are starting to brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
